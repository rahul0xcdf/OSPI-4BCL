Analyzing the Effectiveness of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in Enhancing Web Security

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is widely adopted to enhance web security, but its effectiveness varies across different implementations.

Analyze the security benefits and potential drawbacks of various MFA methods, assessing user compliance, usability, and the resistance of MFA systems to sophisticated attacks such as phishing and social engineering. This will include empirical analysis through user studies and simulations of different attack scenarios. The findings will provide insights into the effectiveness of MFA implementations and recommendations for improving MFA adoption and security.

Implementation Instructions:
npm install
go to Front-end->src->components and do a -----
node server.js----
after that -----npm start----
